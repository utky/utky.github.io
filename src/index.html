I'm <a href='https://github.com/utky'>utky (Yutaka Imamura)</a>, live in Kanagawa, Japan.
I usually write code or router configuration to build network services for production infrastructure.
The main technologies that I've ever used are <i>MPLS</i>, <i>NETCONF</i>, <i>SNMP</i>. They are essential building blocks to provide 
<em>reactive</em>, <em>robust</em> network.
